# Covid-19 cases map

### Data sources
Covid data are from the official [API](https://covid19.moh.gov.sa/) of [Saudi Ministry of Health](https://moh.gov.sa), Despite of the API having a GeoJson data, it wasnâ€™t helpful enough. Therefore, a GeoJson data was taken from [homaily](https://github.com/homaily), However it needed some process before using to remove unnecessary geometry data.  
Thank for them for offering the data publicly.
