# Covid-19 cases map

#### View the map here [Covid19-Map](https://0x0faisal.github.io/Covid19-Map/)

### Data sources
Covid data are from the official [API](https://covid19.moh.gov.sa/) of [Saudi Ministry of Health](https://moh.gov.sa), Despite of the API having a GeoJson data, it wasnâ€™t helpful enough. Therefore, a GeoJson data was taken from [homaily](https://github.com/homaily/Saudi-Arabia-Regions-Cities-and-Districts), However it needed some process before using to remove unnecessary geometry data.
